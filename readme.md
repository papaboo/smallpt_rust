A Rust port of smallpt, http://www.kevinbeason.com/smallpt/. 
All credit for the original smallpt goes to Kevin Beason.

This project was created as a Rust learning experience and is not written for
maximal performance or meant to be squised into 99 lines as the original
project.

To build smallpt_rust, install Rust alpha2, cd into the root folder and execute
$cargo build --release

Execute by $./target/release/smallpt_rust <samples_pr_pixel>

Future work
1) ERPT
2) QMC RNG
3) A-Trous filter
4) ???
5) Profit!
